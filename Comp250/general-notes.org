1. H - "Proof by induction on nn."
2. B - "Base case:"
3. E - "Let n=3n=3, then 2n+1=72n+1=7 which is smaller than 8=2n8=2n."
4. D - "Inductive Hypothesis: suppose 2k+1<2k2k+1<2k for some k>3k>3."
5. F - "Inductive step:"
6. J - "We need to show that 2⋅(k+1)+1<2k+12⋅(k+1)+1<2k+1."
7. G - "Consider 2⋅(k+1)+12⋅(k+1)+1."
9. A - "By expanding brackets and applying the IH, we get 2⋅(k+1)+1=2k+2+1<2k+22⋅(k+1)+1=2k+2+1<2k+2."
10. I - "Which is less than 2k+12k+1, since 2<2k2<2k for any k≥3k≥3."
