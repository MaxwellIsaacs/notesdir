** What is elasticity?
+ *note* what is written below is correct, but also wrong. The slope represents the change in absolute terms, while elasticity is measured in percent change. Basically, the slope is just giving you the change, not telling you how far apart the points are. You know? Like the slope gets simplified, and it only conveys the rate of change, not the rate of change in relation to the whole demand/supply graph
+ It's represented just the slope of the Demand curve. The graphic below conveys this perfectly (the steeper a demand curve, the less elastic the demand is). Elasticity is a metric used to understand the effects of an upward supply shift on demand. Basically, a higher elasticity means that the quantity demanded is highly reliant on the price.

+ In the graphic above, if /p_1/ - /p_0/ > /Q_0/ - /Q_1/ then the demand is elastic. A cool way to think about it is if you draw a secant line between the two points, if the slope is greater than 1 the demand is inelastic, but if it is less than 1 the demand is inelastic, meaning the change in quanitity exceeds the change in price.



** Some of the most retarded rules of all time
+ this only works because the demand and supply curve are on the same scale. This might be the dumbest thing I've ever heard. Why would you ever graph two things on the same graph with different intervals on the x and y axis. How could you even draw this? This seems redundant
+ This one actually makes sense, but it is more of a fact you need. You cannot work with just the absolute change. It means nothing to learn the price of cheese has been reduced 2 dollars per lbs, leading to an increase in 7500 pounds per month. We need to understand the percent change, meaning you need the equilibrium before the supply shift. The table below should illustrate how usless information is without percent change
  [[file:elasticity_table.png]]
+ The table below is much more informative. The averages are useless (or not useless, but you can derive them from the information already in the table), but the rest of the table is crucial to understanding elasticity. They represent the *(x,y)* components of the equilibrium, where x = quantity demanded /or/ supplied && y = price.

** The book now gives the mathmatical definition of elasiticty
- The responsiveness of the quantity of a product to a change in that products price is the PED, or price elasticity of demand. This is represented in the following equation:
\[
\eta = \frac{\text{Percentage change in quantity demanded}}{\text{Percentage change in price}}
\]

- The reason it is not just the slope of the secant line between the points is because of the point made above, [[What is elasticity?][here]].
- The table below is a good repsentation of how to calculate elasticiy
  [[file:elasticity_math_table.png]]
- Since elasticity is percent change, it can never be negative, which the textbook writes as /independent of whether the movement is from *a* to *b* or from *b* to *a*./
- The more rigorous definition for caluclutating the elasticity
  \[
  \eta = \frac{\% \Delta \text{ in } Q}{\% \Delta \text{ in } p} = \frac{\frac{\Delta Q}{\bar{Q}}}{\frac{\Delta p}{\bar{p}}}
  \]
- Elasticity is unit free, it is its own thing
- It is also always positive, even though the two percent changes have different signs and normally would be considered negative


** Elasticity rules
- When the percent change of quantity demanded is less than percent change of price (meaning \(\eta\) < 1), the demand is considered in elastic. The inverse means that \(\eta\) > 1, meaning demand is elastic.
- This kind of creates the piece wise function seen below:
\[
\eta =
\begin{cases}
\eta \geq 1 & \text{elastic} \\
\eta < 1 & \text{inelastic}
\end{cases}
\]
- Moving down a linear demand curve, price elasticity falls continuously, even though slope is constant. This is because the average between two points is not constant, although the rate of change is. I wonder what would happen if you graphed elasticity
- \(\lim_{Q \to 0} \eta = \infty, \quad \lim_{Q \to \infty} \eta = 0\)



** What determines elasticity?
1. Avalibility of subsitutes
2. Importance in Consumers' budgets
   - If someone spends hella money on something already, if it gets to expensive it might just be cut. Something like salt is super cheap and a small portion of your budget, so it isn't really elastic (i.e a 50% increase in price won't affect demand that much)
3. Time period
   - The example is when OPEC raised the price of oil by 400%. In the long run, the demand for oil was very inelastic, since of course people still need to drive. However, in the long run, this pointed out our dependence on oil and encouraged efforts to reduce or outright eliminate oil consumption
   - This sparks the need for two types of demand curves: short run and long run demand curves, which is displayed below.
     [[file:short-vs-long.png]]
   - as you (me) can see, the short term demand curve is much more elastic and the long term curve

** Elasticity and Total Expenditure
- To understand what I'm about to write, you need to know that Total expenditure = Price * Quantity
- If price declines at a slower rate than demand increases, then the demand is elastic and total expenditure goes up. If price decreases at a faster rate than demand increases, this is considered inelastic demand and total expenditure goes down.

** Price Elasticity of Supply
 + This is the repsonsiveness of the quantity supplied to the change in the products' price. This is basicially just a shift of the demand curve instead of the supply curve. The equation below shows how to calculate the Price elasticity of supply, which is the same as elasticity of demand, but just with the percent change of quantity supplied
\[
\eta_S = \frac{\text{Percentage change in quantity supplied}}{\text{Percentage change in price}}
\]
 + However, the slope representation is inverted. Now, the higher the slope the lower the elasticity. The grpah below illustrates this:

** Important Vocab
*** VOCAB Elasticity
  - Definition: How reliant demand is on price
  - Example: A market like diabetes insulin has a very low elasticity, since you need it to surivive. So does housing. A lot of commodities have a high elasticity, such as coffee.
*** VOCAB Total expenditure
- Definition: How much money the producer makes, or how much the consumer spends (glass half empty/half full). Defined by Price * Quantity
- Example: 10 elmo dolls were made at 10 dollars a pop. This means disney (or whoever owns elmo) makes 100$ revenue, and we the consumer lose 100 dollars on bullshit
