Sunlight on a Broken Column by Attia Hosain functions as a domestic novel by centering on the intimate dynamics of family life and social customs, yet it transcends the genre’s conventions by using the domestic realm to explore the tensions between tradition and modernity, colonialism, and the impact of Partition in India.

Uncle Hamid’s defense of the family’s privileges highlights how Sunlight on a Broken Column reinterprets the domestic genre through the lens of India’s explicit caste system. While European social hierarchies are often unspoken, Uncle Hamid openly declares, “We Talugdars have ancient rights and privileges, given by a special charter, which we have to safeguard” (231). His proclamation of these "ancient rights" underscores the rigid, spoken caste distinctions in Indian society, contrasting the subtler—yet equally rigid—unspoken class dynamics in Western domestic novels. Hosain uses the family’s clinging to tradition to reflect broader societal resistance to change, illustrating how the family’s desire to maintain privilege mirrors India’s historical struggle with social stratification. This critique of class hierarchies, a staple of the domestic genre, is thus given a distinct cultural context that enhances the novel’s depth.

Furthermore, the novel addresses the limited roles and expectations placed on women, a recurring theme in domestic narratives. In a moment of quiet rebellion, Sita, a young family member, asks, “Why shouldn’t he? What is wrong with that?” when her brother questions Raza’s religious practices (211). Her defiance subtly critiques the constraints placed on women, who are expected to conform to traditional values and remain submissive. In a similar vein, Nandi, a servant in the household, remains fiercely loyal to the family, despite the sacrifices it demands of her. Faced with the responsibility of caring for her own child along with many other duties, Nandi still tells Laila, “I cannot be faithful to the salt of those who are unkind to you" (290). Through characters like Sita and Nandi, Hosain shows how women navigate—and sometimes resist—the limitations imposed by family and society, underscoring a central aspect of the domestic genre: the quiet, often unspoken, struggle for personal agency within the home.

The tensions between tradition and modernity are further amplified through family hierarchies and generational divides, challenging the typical boundaries of the domestic genre. The protagonist’s interactions with her family often reveal conflicting perspectives on status and lineage. Uncle Mohsin, for instance, dismisses modern ideas and emphasizes family honor by asserting, “I have seen rajas and maharajas…only because they were white sahibs!” (25). His words reveal a reverence for the colonial past and a disdain for the younger generation’s modern attitudes. By anchoring these generational divides within intimate family conversations, Hosain portrays the home as a site of ideological conflict, where members negotiate the past and future of their identity. This depiction extends beyond typical domestic concerns, capturing India’s complex struggle to reconcile deep-rooted traditions with the demands of a rapidly modernizing world.

Mrs. Martin’s role illustrates the lingering effects of colonialism, commentary that is completely foreign to the domestic genre. As Abida’s English teacher, Mrs. Martin warmly recalls her days instructing Abida, commenting, “Dear Lily! Hasn’t she grown?” (47). Her presence reflects the family’s adoption of British values, emphasizing the lingering hold of colonialism on their private lives. Unlike a typical domestic mentor, Mrs. Martin embodies a foreign authority that complicates the family’s cultural identity, transforming the home into a space where colonial influence is both embraced and questioned. This tension between familiarity and foreignness underscores how the family’s identity, like India itself, is shaped by forces beyond their control.

In conclusion, whether or not Sunlight on a Broken Column is a domestic novel is a complex question. The novel does center around Abida and her social and familial connections, and frequently falls into the generic expectations of a domestic novel. However, ____ also confronts themes of colonialism and ____, which is not inherent to the genre. Overall, the novel is aligns with the ethos of the domestic genre: _____.
