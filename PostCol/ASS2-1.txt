Hosain also uses family hierarchies and generational tensions to reflect the clash between tradition and modernity, which is outside the bound of the domestic generic expectations. The protagonist’s interactions with her family often reveal conflicting perspectives on status and lineage. Uncle Mohsin, for instance, dismisses modern ideas and emphasizes family honor by asserting, “I have seen rajas and maharajas…only because they were white sahibs!” (25). His words reveal a reverence for the colonial past and a disdain for the new generation’s modern attitudes. Such scenes underscore the internal family conflicts that represent the broader struggle between upholding traditional values and adapting to a changing world. By anchoring these generational divides within intimate family conversations, Hosain portrays the home as a site of ideological conflict, where members negotiate the past and future of their identity.
